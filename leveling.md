# Leveling

Leveling happens in two ways:
* your "level"
* your "light level"

## Regular Level

Your regular level increases with experience, which is gained by: playing the game, completing story missions, and turning in bounties. This is very straightforward and should happen naturally. You max out your level at 40, and any subsequent "level gains" result in a Mote of Light as an award.

## Light Level

It's useful to describe increasing your light in two phases: pre-290 and post-290.

### Pre-290

Early game refers to leveling your light level before you reach 290. There are specific strategies that are useful to quickly reach 290.

### post-290

Once you reach 290, you're ready to attempt end-game content.
