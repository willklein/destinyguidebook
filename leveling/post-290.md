# Post-290

Once you reach 290, your light leveling will start to slow dramatically. Instead of almost always seeing higher light gear dropping and decrypting, you'll receive more gear below your light level. Gear will decrypt anywhere from 260-300, with only a fraction of it dropping higher than what you have currently equipped.

You will still see your light level rise slowly into the mid-290s, but each level becomes progressively harder to reach. There are a couple quest lines that will reap rewards at light 300 Ultimately, you need to start playing end-game content to break the 300 barrier.

## 300 Light

There are a couple items that can be obtained through known means that will reap 300 light gear.

### Special Weapon

### Artifact
